        :bookmark_tabs:difference between arrow function and regular function
      </h2>
      <span>
        Answer üëçArrow functions ‚Äì a new feature introduced in ES6 ‚Äì enable
        writing concise functions in JavaScript. While both regular and arrow

      <h2>:bookmark_tabs:difference between map foreEach filter find</h2>
      <span
        >Answer üëç Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback
        function on each element of array one by one.2. Filter Whenever you have
        to filter an array Javascript inbuilt method to filter your array is the
        right choice to use. Filter let you provide a callback for every element
        and returns a filtered array.The main difference between forEach and
        filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the
        callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If
        the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the
        return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting
        array.Also take notice filter does not update the existing array it will
        return a new filtered array every time.3. Map One of my favourite and
        most used array method of all time. As a ReactJS developer I use map a
        lot inside my application UI. Map like filter & foreach takes a callback
        and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it unique
        is it generate a new array based on your existing array.When to use
        find? When you want to select a single element from an array.</span

      <h2>:bookmark_tabs:why should we use templat string</h2>
      <span
        >Answer üëç Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript
        released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions
        into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of
        JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain
        dynamic elements.</span
